Poor quality solder joints can cause intermittent changes in resistance, sparking, and high voltage transients.  High quality solder joints require:Sufficient flux to clean oxides off of the wire and the via  Sufficient temperature so that the entire wire and via is hot enough for the solder to wet all surfacesFor the former, it is often necessary to add copious amounts of additional flux in addition to the rosin core inside many solders.  For the latter, a high power soldering iron, with a fat tip, and what seems like a long time may be necessary.  The temperature is definitely insufficient if solder touched to any part of the via or wire does not melt and wick instantly.  Usually a small amount of solder is placed between the tip and wire to act as a heat transfer agent.  Then the iron rests on the via and wire for between 5-30s until it looks like the initial solder has wicked fully into the via.  Then additional solder can be added until it forms a clean smooth fillet around the entire via wicking up to the wire.When complete, the back side of the hole can be examined, and if successful, solder will have wicked partially down out of the via onto the other side forming a clean, smooth fillet there as well.A demonstration of this can be found in the following video:   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZ9w_TaWmjQ","titles":["Deployment Considerations"]},"272":{"title":"Power Cable Construction","content":"When constructing power cables using XT30 connectors, it is critical that solder joints be sound, otherwise intermittent connectivity can result.

For any application where cables may flex, strain relief should be used such that no force is applied to the connector.  The connector may be damaged if a system goes \"out of control\" even in one instance, although milder mechanical stress may cause accelerated fatigue and failure.If sparks are observed, that is   definitely  a problem and the system should be powered off until the connectors can be replaced and mitigations made for what led to that event.Genuine AMASS connectors are rated for 1000 insertions assuming no other mechanical damage, however off-brand connectors may have worse tolerances and may not make a reliable connection for even one insertion.","titles":["Deployment Considerations"]},"274":{"title":"Long daisy chains","content":"When connecting more than 3 moteus controllers or servos in a system on a single power or CAN chain, additional factors should be considered.It is recommended to use T-spliced power instead of using the daisy chained power connectors for chains greater than 3 units.  Small connector mis-seating or micro-arcing will cause magnified effects with long chains of controllers.  CAN bus electrical performance can be a limiting factor.  To operate at the default 5Mbps, you will need to ensure that CAN wires are twisted, all crimps are high quality, and that termination is installed.  Split termination may be required, where two 60 ohm resistors are connected in series with a small filter capacitor connected between the center tap of the resistors and ground.

When braking a load, moteus by default applies the generated power to the input DC bus.If there is nowhere for this power to go, this can cause problems.  The voltage can increase without bound, which in mild cases will cause the CAN transceiver on all devices connected to the bus to fail, and in severe cases can explode the main FETs or other components on the board.Here's what you should know about the facilities moteus has to deal with this, and what you can do to make your design safer.","titles":["Deployment Considerations"]},"276":{"title":"Flux braking","content":"The feature within moteus itself to deal with this is \"flux braking\".  The flux braking implementation will dissipate extra power in the windings of the motor when the bus voltage gets above a certain threshold.  This is controlled by the    and    parameters documented above.","titles":["Deployment Considerations","Regenerative Braking Safety"]},"277":{"title":"Design considerations for regenerative braking","content":"The following design considerations can be used to minimize the risk of damage to hardware in the event of overvoltage.  These are not a substitute for validation in progressively more demanding situations, but they can help you start off in a good place.Configure Flux Braking : To have optimal effect, the flux braking minimum voltage should be approximately only 1.5V above the maximum voltage you expect your supply to provide.  Additionally, the resistance may need to be lowered.  When adjusting the resistance, it is wise to test for stability by gradually increasing the voltage with the drivers engaged using a programmable supply and monitoring for instability in the voltage bus.  This can be identified either with an oscilloscope or audibly.  The default values are set to provide a baseline of protection without compromising the maximum voltage rating of the controller, but more aggressive parameters can be useful when your system voltage is lower and you are able to validate stability.   Power from a battery, not a PSU : When not charged, batteries are capable of sinking current to minimize over-voltage transients.  However, if the battery is fully charged, most battery management systems drastically reduce the allowable charging current.  Thus, a battery is only useful as a mitigation if it is never charged above say 75 or 80% state of charge.   Decrease overall system voltage : If you run the moteus controller with say a 10S battery, the peak input voltage can be as high as 42V.  That does not leave very much margin for regenerative loads.  For applications that experience sharp regenerative loads and do not have a battery capable of charging always attached, it is recommended not to exceed 8S (33.6V peak).   Lower the over-voltage fault : The configuration parameter    can be lowered for all devices on the bus.  If set above the highest expected transient, this can reduce the likelihood of severe transients causing damage.   Use a supply which can sink as well as source : Powering from an inexpensive lab supply is the most dangerous, as they typically have no ability to sink current, only source it.  A \"two quadrant\" supply is the necessary device.","titles":["Deployment Considerations","Regenerative Braking Safety"]},"278":{"title":"PID Tuning","content":"There are two configurable PI(D) controllers on moteus.

They are not normally changed by the user.The position control PID loop parameters are set in    and are selected by the user to achieve a desired control response.Rough tuning rules are as follows:Set kp to be small and kd, ki, and ilimit to be 0.  The kp at this stage should be low enough that any restorative torque is very gradual.  Increase kp by 50% at a time until the desired stiffness is reached.  A command like    can be used to \"hold position\", then manual external disturbances can be used to judge the response.  If the control becomes unstable or vibrates, back off by 50%.  Set kd initially to 1/100th of the kp value.  Increase it by roughly 50% at a time until the desired damping is reached.  If instability or vibration results, back off by 50%.  If zero steady state error is required, then an integrative term is required.  If not, leave    at 0 and you are done.  If configuring an integrative term, set    to be 20% higher than the maximum expected steady state torque.  Then increase ki until the desired response is achieved.     will likely need to be numerically much larger than kp, on the order of 10-1000x larger.
